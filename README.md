This is the code for the travel blog website.

I used HTML and CSS to create the website. I'm still learning web developement. I plan on using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS as a replacement in the future but for now
these 2 languages will do.

I created a design for the website in Adobe Xperience Design (Adobe Xd). I had planned to make 4 blogs but decided to settle on one due to limited time.
I decided to make a blog about summer tourist destinations as it was the most relevant for this time (April 2023). I used Wix to make the blog part as it had a very
good design. I then embedded that blog into the blog section of my website.

This is the first time I'm sharing my own code.
